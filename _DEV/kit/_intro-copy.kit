	<h2>What is this?</h2>
	
	<p>The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture" target="ccout">Collatz Conjecture</a> is an unsolved problem in mathematics which asks if repeating two simple arithmetic operations will eventually transform any positive integer to 1.</p>
	
	<p>The reason this is an unsolved problem is because no proof has yet been produced for whether or not this works for <em>any</em> positive integer.</p>
