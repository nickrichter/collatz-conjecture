	<h2>Observations</h2>
	
	<p>Since the process is so simple I haven't noticed too many things that yield unusual results. Probably the closest thing to "quirky" that I've observed is if the output is some power of 2 you will get that many "divide by 2" operations until you reach 1. That's fairly obvious as the opposite of "divide by 2" is "multiply by 2" and it's not too drastic a leap to get to 2<sup>y</sup>. In the following example, let's input 2&#8312; (256).</p>

			<div>
				<p><strong>Input:</strong> <span class="numbers">256</span></p>
				<div class="arithmatic">256 &divide; 2 &equals; 128</div>
				<div class="arithmatic">128 &divide; 2 &equals; 64</div>
				<div class="arithmatic">64 &divide; 2 &equals; 32</div>
				<div class="arithmatic">32 &divide; 2 &equals; 16</div>
				<div class="arithmatic">16 &divide; 2 &equals; 8</div>
				<div class="arithmatic">8 &divide; 2 &equals; 4</div>
				<div class="arithmatic">4 &divide; 2 &equals; 2</div>
				<div class="arithmatic">2 &divide; 2 &equals; <span class="solution">1</span></div>
			</div>

	<p>I am not a math professional, or even an amateur for that matter, so I have no idea how to go about finding anything truly interesting or odd. Maybe you'll have more luck in that regard.</p>
